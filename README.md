# My Projects from the Computer Vision Nanodegree

## About
This is a repository for documenting my education of Computer Vision. It includes the projects and tutorials I completed sucessfully from the Udacity's [Computer Vision Nanodegree program](https://www.udacity.com/course/computer-vision-nanodegree--nd891). I have learnt cutting-edge computer vision and deep learning techniques â€” from basic image processing, to building and customizing convolutional neural networks. These concepts are used for vision tasks such as automatic image captioning and object tracking.
