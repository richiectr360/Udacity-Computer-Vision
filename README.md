# My Projects from the Computer Vision Nanodegree

## About
In the [Computer Vision Nanodegree program](https://www.udacity.com/course/computer-vision-nanodegree--nd891), I have learnt deep learning concepts that are applied to Computer Vision tasks. These concepts are used for vision tasks such as automatic image captioning and object tracking.

### Projects
1) Facial Keypoint Detection - Use image processing techniques and deep learning techniques to detect faces in an image and find facial keypoints, such as the position of the eyes, nose, and mouth on a face. This project tests your knowledge of image processing and feature extraction techniques that allow you to programmatically represent different facial features. Youâ€™ll also use your knowledge of deep learning techniques to program a convolutional neural network to recognize facial keypoints. Facial keypoints include points around the eyes, nose, and mouth on any face and are used in many applications, from facial tracking to emotion recognition.
2) Automatic Image Captioning - Combine CNN and RNN knowledge to build a deep learning model that produces captions given an input image. Image captioning requires that you create a complex deep learning model with two components: a CNN that transforms an input image into a set of features, and an RNN that turns those features into rich, descriptive language. In this project, you will implement these cutting-edge deep learning architectures.
3) Landmark Detection and Tracking - Use feature detection and keypoint descriptors to build a map of the environment with SLAM(simultaneous localization and mapping). Implement a robust method for tracking an object over time, using elements of probability, motion models, and linear algebra. This project tests your knowledge of localization techniques that are widely used in autonomous vehicle navigation.
